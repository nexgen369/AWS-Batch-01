Git Stages:
-----------
1.Working directory (tree)
-This is your local project directory where you create, edit, delete files
-Nothing but files here are untracked or modified

command:
	git status
	
Add file to staging:
	git add file
	
2.Staging Area(Index):
-A temporary holding space where you put changes ready for the next commit
-You control exactly what goes into the next commit

command:(Add all changes)
	git add .
	
3.Local respository(.git):
-your committed history stored inside the .git directory.
-once committed -> safely stored in Git respository

command:
	git commit -m "nexgen"
	
View commit history:
	git log --online
