SNS(Simple Notification service):
---------------------------------
Definition: SNS is a fully managed messaging and notification service.
That follow the publish/subscribe(pub/sub) model.

.Publisher-->sends a message to a topic
.Subscriber-->receive the message(email, SMS)

when you create TOPIC:
Topic types: 
1)FIFO: Subscription protocols: SQS
2)Standard: Subscription protocols: SQS, Lambda, Data Firehose, HTTP, SMS, email, mobile application endpoints


Key concepts:
-------------
.Topic: A communication channel (Ex: ordersTopic)
.Publisher:Sends a message to the topic
.Subscriber:Endpoints (Email, SMS)

How it Works:
-------------
Create a SNS Topic
Add Subscriber	(like email/SMS)
Publisher sends a message to the topic
SNS deliver the message to all subscribers

Example:
1.EC2 CPU utilization
	When server reach 80% threshold u will get notification


2.E-commerce application
	-When a new order is placed-->an event is publised to SNS topic
	-Subscribers:
		.Customers gets Email/SMS confirmation
		.Admin gets a Slack/HTTP notification

Use cases:
----------		
.Send alerts/notifications (with cloudwatch,EC2)
.Fan-out messaging->one event trigger multiple actions			 


AWS Cloudtrail:
---------------
-tracks users activity
-Cloud trail is a service that helps you track and monitor all actions taken in your aws
account-by users, services or applications

-It's mainly used for security, auditing and compliance purpose

Simple Definition:
-------------------
Cloudtrail records who did what, when, and from where in your aws environment

Key features:
-------------
1.Event Logging: Records API calls and console actions (eg: creating EC2, deleting S3 etc..)
2.User Tracking: Identities which IAM user, role, or service performed an actions
3.S3 Integration: Stores log files automatically in S3
4.Cloudwatch Integration: Sends notification or triggers alerts
5.Event History: Lets you view recent events (last 90 days) 

How Cloudtrail Works:
---------------------
1.Enable Cloudtrail: Usually one trail per account
2.Choose S3 bucket: where all logs will be saved
3.Optionally integrate with Cloudwatch logs to monitor
4.View or query logs

Goal:
-----
.Record all API activity in AWS
.Store logs in an s3 bucket
.Send events to cloudwatch logs for monitoring and alertig 

steps for cloudtrail configuration:
-----------------------------------

Example use case:
-----------------
.A developer accidently deletes an s3 bucket
-->you can open cloudtrail and see who deleted it, when, and from where (IP)

Cloud Watch:
------------
.Cloudwatch is a monitoring and observability service
.It collects metrics, logs, and event from aws resources and applications
and lets you:
	-Monitor performace
	-Set alarms
	-Troubleshoot issues
	-Visualize everything in dashboards
	
Key features:
-------------
1.Metrics: collect utilization (EC2 CPU usage, disk I/O, memory, network
2.Logs: collects data from application
3.Alarms: Trigger actions when metrics across the threshold
Ex: if CPU > 80% for minutes --> send alert or stop/start an instance

Alarm state trigger:
--------------------
1.In alarm: The metric or expression is outside of the defined threshold.
2.ok alarm: The metric or expression is within the defined threshold
3.Insufficient data	: The alarm has just started or not enough data is available.

ELB: Elastic Load Balancer:
---------------------------		
The 7 OSI Layers: the OSI(open system interactions) model, explain how data moves from one system to another system over the network.
-it used to design, understand, troubleshoot and map network services including aws.

	1.Layer7- Application layer
	what it does, Provides network services to end user applications

	Protocols:
	.HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP
	
	Trouble shoot:
	.website returns 500 error ---> Application issue
	
	2.Layer6- Presentation layer
	What it does, Data formatting, encryption, compresssion
	
	protocols:
	.SSL/TLS (converts http to https)
	
	Trouble shoot:
	.SSL handshakes failure --> Presentation layer issue
	
	3.Layer5-Session layer:
	What it does, Manges sessions between systems
	
	example:
	Authentication sessions
	
	Trouble shoot:
	User logged out frequently--> session issue 
	
	4.Layer4-Transport layer:
	what it does, data transfer and port mangement
	
	Protocols:
	.TCP, UDP
	
	trouble shoot:
	Connection timeout on port 443 --> Transport issue
	
	5.Layer3-Network layer:
	what is does, Routing and IP addressing
	
	Protocol:
	ip(internet protocol)
	
	6.Layer2-Data link
	what it does, MAC addressing and frame delivery
	
	protocols
	Ethernet
	
	7.layer1-Physical layer:
	what it does, transmission of bits
	
	Examples
	.cables, Switches
	
	
What is ELB?
------------
ELB automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets(EC2 instances) to ensure,

		-High availability
		-Scalability
		-Better application performance
		
		
		Example:
		flipkart big billion day sale between jan 24th to 27th
		how many servers required to run my flipkart app?
		can i create EC2 servers manually to my application ?
		To run my application i really dont know how many servers required?
		
		ASG(Autoscaling group): Automatically increases/add and decreases/remove EC2 instances based on incoming application traffic.
		
		min size: 1
		desired capacity: 2
		Max size: 5---------------> Monthly billing(EC2 run time)
		
		
		
		under vertical scaling and horizontal scaling?
		
		what is vertical scaling?
		Ans: Increasing the server resources (CPU/RAM/ROM)---Flipkart (10lakh RPM)
		
		What is horizontal scaling?
		Ans: Increasing no of servers

Autoscaling group components:

1.Launch template:
	-AMI(Amazon machine images-OS(linux/windows)
	-Instance type( choose no of CPU and RAM, ex:t2.micro)
	-Key pair (securely connect instance)
	-Networking (default), subnets, route tables, nat, internetgateway etc
	-EBS (elastic block store), only for EC2, volumes, 16TB (SSD/HDD), Ec2 is accidentlty deleted , data EBS

2.Group Size:
