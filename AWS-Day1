6.Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)	
-----------------------------------------
IaaS(Infrastructure as a service):
	-IaaS delivers on-demand infrastructure resources, such as (servers, storage, networking and virtualization.
	-With IaaS the service provider owns and operates the infrastructure, but cutomers will need to purchase and manage software, such as (OS, data, and applications)
	
PaaS(Platform as as service):
	-PaaS delivers and manages hardware and software resources for developing, testing, delivering and managing cloud applications.
	-Providers typically offer develpment tools, and cloud database with PaaS
	
SaaS(Sofware as a service):
	-SaaS provides a full application stack as a service that customers can access and use.
	-SaaS solutions often come as read-to-use applictions, which are managed by the cloud service provider.

	SaaS Examples:
	--------------
		-Microsoft 365
		-Zoom
		-Teams
		-Jira

8.IAM- Identity and access managemnent(security service):
---------------------------------------------------------
Difference between root user and IAM user:


Root User:
----------
	-The account created when an AWS account is firt set up
	-Uses the email and passord used to register the AWS account/for login also uses same details & MFA
	-Root account has full access, unrestricted accsss to all AWS services and billing.
	-Root user will create IAM user
	-Root user not suggested to use day-to-day interactions
	
IAM User:
---------
	-A user created under the AWS account(root account) using identity and Access managment
	-IAM user has only the permission explicity assinged via polices (limited permissions) 
	-IAM user login using link(username, password, 12digit account number & MFA


	Example: We have project(using AWS services such as EC2, S3, database)
			Team lead (root user)
			user-1: only EC2 permission no other permission
			user-2: only s3 permission no other permission
			user-3: only database permission no other permission
				
				
			Groups: Dev Team (permission cloudfront access)	
					user-1 added under the group
					
					EC2+cloudfront
