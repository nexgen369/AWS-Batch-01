What is Cloud Computing?
------------------------
Cloud computing is nothing on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing model.
That you can access technical services

Ex: Storage, server, database, networking etc

Cloud Providers: 1.AWS (Amazon web services 200+ services globally)
				 2.Azure (Micro soft 100+ services globally)
				 3.GCP (Google cloud 100+ services globally)
				 
Pay-as-you-go : nothing just pay what you use
				Ex: Storage from AWS Jan-1GB/Feb-2GB/Mar-3GB
                There is no upfrontcost (no intial payment required, you start using it without paying anything
