S3 Storage Class:						Use Case:						    cost:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.S3 standard							Frequent access data				High/Milliseconds
2.S3 standard-infrequent access			Occasional access					Medium/Milliseconds
3.S3 intelligent Tiering				Unknown access pattern				Auto moves between tiers/milliseconds
4.S3 one zone-IA						Infrequent access, single AZ		Lower than standard-IA/Milliseconds
5.S3 Glacier Instant Retrival			Fast retrival						Low/milliseconds
6.S3 Glacier flexible Retrival			Not infrequent retrival				cheaper/Minutes to Hours
7.S3 glacier deep Archive				Very long-term storage 				Cheaper storage/Hours
8.S3 Express One Zone					Ultr low latency high 
										performance, single AZ				High
9.S3 Access Grants						Fine-grained permission				add-on													


Note:
high latency : low transfer speed 
low latency: high tansfer speed

AWS Cloud Front(edge Locations):
--------------------------------
-Cloudfront is CDN(Global Content Delivery Network)

- cloud front desinged to deliver content (web pages, images, videos, APIs, software, static and dyamic content) to users with low latency and high transfer speed.
-It works by caching content at edge locations world wide, so that users can access data from server closest to them.
-In india we have 33 edge locations

Core Concepts:
--------------

When a user requests content:
	1.Request goes to the nearest cloudfront edge location.
	2.if cached(cache hit), Cloudfront returns it immediately
	3.If not cached (cache miss), Cloudfront fetch it from origin (S3)
	4.It caches the content for future request based on TTL(Time to Live)
	5.Returns content to user with minimal latency
	
Key Components:
---------------
Origin:  Locations where original content is stored (S3 bucket)
Distrubtion: Speedup delivey content


Why Cloudfront is Used:
-----------------------
-Low Latency high performance
-Global content delivery
-Cost optimization

Usecase:
--------
Website acceleration: HTML, CSS, JS, Images
Video streaming: OTT platforms

How it Works:
-------------
User->DNS Resolves to near edge location->Cloudfront cache

Pricing Model(High-Level):
--------------------------
-Data Transfer Out
-Requests(of HTTP/HTTPS requests)

(S3 + Cloud Front + Route 53)
