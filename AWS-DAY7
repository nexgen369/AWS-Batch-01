Tmr Class: Will Understand about CI/CD (Jenkins):
------------------------------------------------
what is Jenkins?
-Jenkins is open source automation server used to implement CI/CD(Contineous Integration/Contineous delivery/deployment) pipelines
-It automates building, testing, security scanning and application deployment
-Jenkins is DevOps tool


Why Jenkins is Used?
--------------------
-Automates code build, test and deployment
-Reduces manual errors
-Enables fast feedback to developers
-Support micro services and monolathic applications
-Integrates with almost all DevOps tools

Understand what is monolithic vs Micoservices Application/Architect:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Monolithic Architecture: A monolithic application is built as one large, tightly-coupled unit where
all componenets (UI, business logic, database access, etc) are combined into a single codebase and
deployed together.

Ex: Order Management Service
	Inventory & Catalog Service
	Payment Service
	Cart Service


characteristics:
----------------
.single codebase--> one build, one deployment
.All features---(login, payments, products, orders, etc) are inside one service 
.Uses one database (usually)
.Easy to develop initially, but harder to scale and maintain later.

Example:
--------
An e-commerce application where:
.Authentication, products catalog, orders, payments, notifications--->all live inside one codebase.
.If you update the "Payments" module, you need to redeploy the entire application.

Micro services Architecture:
----------------------------
A microservices application is built as a collection of small, independent services, each responsible for
one feature or functionality
.Each service has its own codebase and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
.Service communicate via APIs (REST)
.Each service can use its own database.

characteristics:
----------------
.Loosely coupled and independent
.Easier to scale individual services
.Teams can work on different services at the same time.
.More complex to manage (needs service discovery, monitoring, orchestration like K8S/Ansible/Cloud

Example:
--------
The same e-commerce application in microservices:
.Auth Service--> hanldes login/signup---Cont1
.Product Service-->manages orders---Cont2
.Order Service-->handles orders----Cont3
.Payment Service-->process payments---Cont4
.Notification-->sends emails/SMS---Cont5


2.Jenkins in CI/CD flow:
------------------------
-Developer push code to git
-Jenkins detects changes via webhook
-Jenkins pulls code
-Jenkins builds the application
-Jenkins runs test
-Jenkins performs quality/security checks
-Deploy to enviroments (Dev/Test/Prod)

what is Dev/Test/Prod?
----------------------
1.Dev(Development):
	Purpose: -Build and change code
			 -used by developers
			 -Frequent code changes
			 -May be unstable
			 -Fast deployment
			 
			 Example: Developer push code --> Jekins builds --> deploys to Dev
			 
2.Test(QA/Staging):
	Purpose: -Validate before production
			 -used by QA, automation
			 -Stable compared to Dev
			 -Runs performance test
			 -Runs security test
			 -Production-like configuration
			 
			 Example: Dev-approved build --> deployed to Test --> test cases executed
			 
3.Prod(Production):
	Purpose: -Serve real users
			 -Live environment
			 -Real data and transaction
			 -Strict access control
			 -monitorning and alert enabled
			 -Zero-downtime deployments 
			 
			 Example: Test-approved build --> deployed to Prod --> users access application
			 
Final Flow: Dev --> Test --> Prod

Note:
Dev, Test, and Prod are isolated environment used to develop, validate and safely run applications without impacting end users.

Jenkins Installation:
---------------------
-Create EC2 (ubuntu, t2.micro, storage 20gb, allow protocols http/https/all traffic)
-connect to instance install jenkins in EC2

commands:
update system
	-sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
install java(Required)
	-sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
	
	-curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
  
	-echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
  
   -sudo apt-get update
   -sudo apt-get install jenkins
   
   access jenkins using your EC2 public ip address and jenkins port No: 3.238.132.70:8080 
   
   To unlock jenkins Get the initial administrative password
	-sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
	
	pass: 60deabaf864045c2bdb648b5ae35c483
	
	Provide pwd which we have copied to unlock jenkins

-> Select "Install Suggested Plugins" card (it will install those plugins)

-> Create Admin account
	username:siva
	password:Siva@123
	fullname:sivakumar
	email id:vsivakumar668@gmail.com
